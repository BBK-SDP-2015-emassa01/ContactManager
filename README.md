ContactManager
==============
Assignment 2 (v1.1)
Programming in Java
2013–14
1 Introduction
Launching a start-up company is diﬃcult. Apart from creating a great product, you must talk to a lot of people to
get them interested in the project: clients, venture capital, government agencies. . . it is really diﬃcult to keep track
of everybody!
When is your next meeting? Who will you meet? What did they say the last time you talked to them?
The purpose of this assignment it writing a program to keep track of contacts and meetings. The application
will keep track of contacts, past and future meetings, etc. When the application is closed, all data must be stored in
a text ﬁle called ”contacts.txt”. This ﬁle must be read at startup to recover all data introduced in a former session
(the format of the ﬁle if up to you: you can use XML, comma-separated values (CSV), or any other format).
2 Implementation details
The program should implement the interfaces provided below. Classes that implement an interface should have
the same name with the “Impl” suﬃx unless there is more than one. For example, if there is only one class that
implements ContactManager, it must be called ContactManagerImpl. Be careful with this, as it may interfere with
automatic tools that will analyse your code.

There is no main() method, or launch menu, but the implementation is provided. Tests have been made using JUnit and 
a tester main() is also included in the package.

Enjoy!
